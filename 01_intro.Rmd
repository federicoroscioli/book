# Installation

 

 

 

## Introductory activities

First of all we need to install the software that will allow us to work
with the R language [@rcoreteam2022]. We will need to install two
software: R and R-Studio. The first is a compiler for the R language, we
need to install it but we will never use it directly. The latter is an
interface software that runs on top of R and allows us to have some
facilitation and suggestions while working. Within this manual I will
use R and R-Studio as synonyms, but I will be referring always to the
use of R-Studio.

Additional to R and R-Studio we will need to install some packages. The
packages are extension of the software that bring in additional
functions and/or data.

To install the software, follow all the 9 steps below:

1.  Download the R installer from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).\

<!-- ```{r, echo=F, out.width="100%", fig.show="hold", fig.cap="Select the version of R according to your operating system."} -->
<!--  knitr::include_graphics("/Volumes/New/lavori/corso R/materiali/cran.png") -->
<!-- ``` -->


    <!-- ![Select the version of R according to your operating -->

    <!-- system.](/Volumes/New/lavori/corso%20R/materiali/cran.png)\ -->

2.  Run the installer keeping the default settings. If you do not have admin rights on your computer, please ask you IT Support to give you full permissions to the R directories. Otherwise you will not be able to install packages afterwards.

3.  Download the R-Studio installer from [R-Studio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).\

<!-- ```{r, echo=F, out.width="100%", fig.show="hold", fig.cap="Select the version of R-Studio according to your operating system."} -->
<!--  knitr::include_graphics("/Volumes/New/lavori/corso R/materiali/rstudio.png") -->
<!-- ``` -->


4.  Once the installation of R is completed (NOT BEFORE), run the R-Studio installer keeping the default settings.

5.  Run R-Studio. It should open an window like the one in the image below.\

<!-- ```{r, echo=F, out.width="100%", fig.show="hold", fig.cap="R-Studio."} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("/Volumes/New/lavori/corso R/materiali/rstudio2.png") -->
<!-- ``` -->


6.  In the left hand window, by the sign "\>", type "4+5" (without the quotes) and hit enter. An output line reading "$[1]$ 9" should appear. This means that R and R-Studio are working properly. If this is not successful, please [contact me]([mailto:%20info\@federicoroscioli.com](mailto:%20info@federicoroscioli.com){.uri}).

7.  Go to Tools -\> Install Packages and install the packages:"gt", and "readxl". See the image below.\

<!-- ```{r, echo=F, out.width="100%", fig.show="hold"} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("/Volumes/New/lavori/corso R/materiali/pkg1.png") -->
<!-- ``` -->


8.  Check that the packages are installed by typing "library(gt)" (without the quotes) in the prompt and press enter.\

<!-- ```{r, echo=F, out.width="100%", fig.show="hold"} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("/Volumes/New/lavori/corso R/materiali/pkg2.png") -->
<!-- ``` -->


9.  Finally type "sessioninfo()" (without the quotes) and check that gt has been installed.\

<!-- ```{r, echo=F, out.width="100%", fig.show="hold"} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("/Volumes/New/lavori/corso R/materiali/pkg3.png") -->
<!-- ``` -->

 

 

 

 

## Visualization suggestions

Following some visualization suggestions that you may explore.
Personally, I find them really helpful.

-   Setting the work-space:

    -   View -\> Panes -\> Panes Layout\
    -   clockwise from top-left you should have: Source, Environment,
        Files, Console

-   Setting the color style of the code:

    -   Tools \> Global Options -\> Appearance -\> Editor Theme -\>
        Xcode

 

 

 

 

## The workspace

<!-- ```{r, echo=F, out.width="100%", fig.show="hold"} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("/Volumes/New/lavori/corso R/materiali/workspace.png") -->
<!-- ``` -->

The **source** is a text file with extension .R that can be saved and
opened from every version of R and R-Studio. This file will allow us to
run and rerun a bunch of code, modify some details if we made a mistake
or if we want to change something. This will always be our best friend.

The **Environment** is the place where R saves temporarily all the data
that we tell "him" to save. The environment will never be clean or
contain only the essential objects you need (maybe this will happen when
you will be a great programmer, but not for now). We will see there all
your data-sets, variables, vectors, etc...

The bottom right part of the screen is devoted to many things.
**Viewer**, **Plots** and **Help** will be activated automatically to
show you the requested output. **Packages**, instead, is useful only
when we have to install new packages.

The **Console** is where we can write some code that will not be saved,
if not in the temporary history of the console itself. This space is
also where R give us the feedback of our inputs in the form of results,
warnings and errors.
