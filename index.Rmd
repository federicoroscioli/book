# Preface {.unnumbered}

<!-- Add Spatial inference -->

The real goal of this manual is not to teach the R language per se, but
to allow the students to manage the basic concepts in order to be able
to explore and analyze data using R. After this course the student will
be capable of clearly understand the R code that someone else wrote and
customize her own code according to the need. This means having the
possibility to explore different and more complex solutions for the
student's problems by exploring new packages and paving the way to
become a statistician!

I also created also an ad-hoc **R playground** accessible
[here](https://federicoroscioli.shinyapps.io/exercises/). The R
playground allows the student to exercise in order to reinforce her
knowledge of R and data analysis. Exercises are fundamental in order to
fix the knowledge acquired in class. The platform is structured in the
same way as this manual in order to have a linear learning process. I
finally want to remark that the code I provide is "my best and easiest
version of the solution", I hope you will appreciate it. In fact, with
R, it is possible to do the same thing in 1000 different ways, and by
looking at the internet you can have a confirmation of it.
