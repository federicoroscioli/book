# Preface {.unnumbered}

This manual is composed by two main sections divided in chapters. The
first section will introduce the reader to the basic characteristics of
the software required, its installation and configuration, it will then
have a linguistic focus, so it aims at teaching how to use R in order to
visualize, explore, understand, manipulate and create data. It will do
so in a progressive way, starting from simple computations and ending
with complex data manipulation and plotting. The second section,
instead, will be all about applied statistics, from exploratory
analysis, to the introduction of the normal distribution and its
implications, to bivariate and multivariate analysis methods, such as
principal component analysis and classification and regression trees.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I also created also an ad-hoc **R playground** accessible
[here](https://federicoroscioli.shinyapps.io/exercises/). The R
playground allows the student to exercise in order to reinforce her
knowledge of R and data analysis. Exercises are fundamental in order to
fix the knowledge acquired in class. The platform is structured in the
same way as this manual in order to have a linear learning process. I
finally want to remark that the code I provide is "my best and easiest
version of the solution", I hope you will appreciate it. In fact, with
R, it is possible to do the same thing in 1000 different ways, and by
looking at the internet you can have a confirmation of it.

The real goal of this manual is not to teach the R language per se, but
to allow the students to manage the basic concepts in order to be able
to explore and analyze data using R. After this course the student will
be capable of clearly understand the R code that someone else wrote and
customize her own code according to the need. This means having the
possibility to explore different and more complex solutions for the
student's problems by exploring new packages and paving the way to
become a statistician!

Many people think of R as a statistics system. I prefer to consider it
an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R
can be extended (easily) via packages allowing to execute various
statistical and graphical techniques, including linear and nonlinear
modeling, classical statistical tests, spatial and time-series analysis,
classification, clustering, and others.

**If this is your first time coding**, R may be slow and tedious at the
beginning. You will pass a lot of your time trying to understand why R
is giving you an error instead of the solution to your problem. [Stack
Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and the R Help will become your
best friends. The software is going to seem to judge your mistakes
harshly. You will read the word "syntax error" a lot. And you will
probably grow a kind of hate for the creature that lives inside the
computer and that does not like you. You will think the creature is
value judging your code. You will crash the laptop and loose all your
data... Ok, ok! I'm a bit exaggerating... I don't want to scare you too
much, but yes, this is the worst case scenario and many of your
colleagues already passed through that, and survived!

```{r, echo=F, out.width="100%", fig.show="hold"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/8psue2xkvn811.jpg")
```

The fact is that, R is a language and, as such, should be practiced as
much as possible in order to learn it. But R is "only" a coding
language, so you will not be not able to speak *Rish* with your friends
(fortunately!) nor write a letter to your pals. The only option you have
is to practice it with your computer (also in group if you prefer). All
the syntax errors you will get do not mean that R thinks you're bad. It
is not a judgment of your ability as a statistician. Syntax errors mean
R is lost and doesn't have better words to tell you that. Beside the
fact that it can allow you to do marvelous things, R understands only
when you talk to him in his language. So, my suggestion when you get an
error is:

1.  Read out loud the error and try to make sense of where the problem
    is (usually R suggest you that).

2.  Check carefully your code, there may be a missing comma or a
    misspelled capital letter.

3.  Copy paste the error on google and look for answers. This works more
    than what you may think.

4.  [Contact me](mailto:info@federicoroscioli.com).

The above steps almost always work, but in general I want you to never
loose your effort. You will figure it out, be sure about it. You only
need to build some experience first. It is like when you learn to ride a
bicycle, at the beginning you have to fall a lot, but in the end you
will love cycling and you will never want to get off your bike.

As a final wish for you: during my first contact with R, I was "lost",
"lost", "lost", "lost", "lost", "oh wow, I love this!". And I hope that
all of you will go through that exact same feeling.

So, please, **have fun, be curious, and exercise a lot!**
