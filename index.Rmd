This manual is composed by two main sections divided in chapters. The
first section will introduce the reader to the basic characteristics of
the software required, its installation and configuration, it will then
have a linguistic focus, so it aims at teaching how to use R in order to
visualize, explore, understand, manipulate and create data. It will do
so in a progressive way, starting from simple computations and ending
with complex data manipulation and plotting. The second section,
instead, will be all about applied statistics, from exploratory
analysis, to the introduction of hypothesis testing and its
implications, to bivariate and multivariate analysis methods, such as
principal component analysis and classification and regression trees.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I also created also an ad-hoc **R playground** accessible
[here](https://federicoroscioli.shinyapps.io/exercises/). The R
playground allows the student to exercise in order to reinforce her
knowledge of R and data analysis. Exercises are fundamental in order to
fix the knowledge acquired in class. The platform is structured in the
same way as this manual in order to have a linear learning process. I
finally want to remark that the code I provide is "my best and easiest
version of the solution", I hope you will appreciate it. In fact, with
R, it is possible to do the same thing in 1000 different ways, and by
looking at the internet you can have a confirmation of it.
